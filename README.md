# Crux

## Description

Based on the classic game of Chess, Crux extends the board to 14x14 and introduces 5 new pieces: the Archbishop, the Camel, the Guard, the Amazon and the Chancellor. These pieces are a combination of existing pieces, and are designed to add a new layer of strategy to the game. Extending the program further, a Min-Max algorithm is implemented to allow the user to play against the computer with varying levels of difficulty.
